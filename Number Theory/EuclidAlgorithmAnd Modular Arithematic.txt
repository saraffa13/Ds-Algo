1. (A + B) %Mod = ((A%Mod) + (B%Mod))%Mod;
2. (A - B) %Mod = ((A%Mod) - (B%Mod))%Mod;
3. (A * B) %Mod = ((A%Mod) * (B%Mod))%Mod;

4.O(log (max(a,b))) 
int gcd(int a, int b){
    if(b == 0)return a;
    return gcd(b,a%b); 
}


5. Additive Modulo Inverse
   A is modulo inverse to b with respect to some number N if and only if A and B gives the same remainder when divided by N.
   hence, (A-B) will be divisible by N.
          
   Vice versa, If X is divisible by N then we can write X as a difference of two numbers and those two number will be modulo inverse 
   each other with respect to N.
6. Multiplicative Modulo Inverse
   A*B = C 
   then (A%N) * (B%N) .-. C%N

7. Check whether the number is divisible by 3 and 9 or not
   sum of the digits must be divisible by 3 or 9

8. If A and B are congruent to each other  with respect to N than 
    (A^k) is also congurent to (B^k)

    If we have to find out (A^K) % N then we can also find out (B^k)%N if A and B are congruent to each other.

    (1024%3) = (1+2+4)%3

9. Modulo Multiplicative Inverse :- 
    (A/B)%N = (A%N * C%N) %N  {where, B and C and modulo Multiplicative inverse of each other}
                              which means( B*C )%N = 1

               does modulo Multiplicative inverse exists for every number -  the answer is no 
                              Multiplicative inverse of B under N only exists iff gcd (B,N) = 1, or B and N are co-prime.

   
   Modulo Multiplicative Inverse :-
   int MultiplicativeInverse(int a, int m){
      return binPowMod(a,m-2,m);
   }

   m should be prime and (a,m) must be coprime.
