articulation points - It is also known as cut vertex. 
                      Articulation points lies at the end of the bridges iff the node has degree greater than 2.
                      Articulation points doesn't need to lie at the end points of bridges only.
                      Articulation points can be find out using that same algo of finding the bridge.

void dfs(int v, int p=-1){
    vis[v] = 1;
    inTime[v] = lowTime[v] = timer++;
    int children=0;
    for(auto &x:edges[v]){
        if(x == p)continue;
        else if(vis[x]){
            lowTime[v] = min(lowTime[v],inTime[x]);
        }else{
            dfs(x,v);
            lowTime[v] = min(lowTime[v],lowTime[x]);
            if(lowTime[x]>=inTime[v]&&p!=-1){
                isCutpoint(v);
            }
            children++;
        }
    }
    if(p == -1 && children>1){
        isCutpoint(v);
    }
}
